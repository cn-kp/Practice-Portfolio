# Homework Week 2: Creating My Webpage Portfolio

For this week's homework, I have created a webpage to display some of my projects for potential employers to see, as well as some personal information and contact details to reach me

## User Story 
As an employer, I want to be able to see potential candidates and review their personal achievements and work projects to see if they are suited for the job. I also want to be able to know more about the potential candidate through external social media, review their resume and be able to contact them through the provided social media. 

As a developer, my objective is to establish a webpage that is accessible and optimised to display some personal information about myself, showcase some work I have done and link my social media to increase employability. The webpage should be operational,
