# Homework Week 2: Creating My Webpage Portfolio

For this week's homework, I have created a webpage to display some of my projects for potential employers to see, as well as some personal information and contact details to reach me

## User Story 
As an employer, I want to be able to see potential candidates and review their personal achievements and work projects to see if they are suited for the job. I also want to be able to know more about the potential candidate through external social media, review their resume and be able to contact them through the provided social media. 

As a developer, my objective is to establish a webpage that is accessible and optimised to display some personal information about myself, showcase some work I have done and link my social media to increase employability. The webpage should be operational, highlight key projects, means to contact me, clickable links to scroll to the appropiate sections and have a responsive layout that adjusts to the user's viewport.

## Acceptance Criteria
The Webpage will be done when the below is completed to a satisfactory level
1) The Webpage is layed out with a UI navigation bar which automatically scrolls to the appropriate section when it is clicked
2) Titles and headers should be easily seen through the use of contrasting colours, bolded fonts or underlines.
3) The work projects should clearly stand out and a glow should indicate that youre hovered over it.
4) the webpage should be responsive and automatically adjust itself to the user's viewport to accompany all users.
5) The code should be organised and sequential so it is easily followed
6) Displays the necessary information such as a brief introduction of yourself, your project highlights and contact details.
7) Finally, the webpage should be organised, ensuring the sidebar matches up with the main content, is somewhat appealing to look at and is layed out accordingly
